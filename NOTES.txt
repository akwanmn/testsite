NOTES:
- When using case sensitive usernames, the issue is that Andy is not equal to andy. So two people
  could be confused for the same person because Andy and andy are different when its case sensitive.
  I recommend against this and make everything lower case.

- I added other to Ethnicity, but this list is the same as the other site besides "Other". I also
  broke a couple apart to make it bigger.

- Timezone is now alphabatized.

- The main page. I don't know what "original font" means, since the current live site it has an image.
  To reduce loading time I made it text. We can change fonts and I already have to try and make it look
  more like the current site.

- I made the promo section (part with time, daily news etc smaller). Moving to the page is a really really
  bad idea for promotional purposes, and would take some re-work of the design across the site to do, it can
  be done, but I think it provides credibility to the site.

- Make zipcodes mandatory? Not sure what is meant by that.  It is mandatory I even have tests that I run before
  deploying verifying this. If you found a place where that is not the case please screenshot it.

- Save users password on join page. That is not a thing that I can typically change. That is a browser function
  that keeps people from brute forcing. It's a pain, but it actually is a security aspect of browsers.

- When the user is created (joins) it should take you to the edit profile page, if the profile is < X %.  We can
  force this to a much higher value if you want.  Right now it is < 50%.  If you want to make that the default page
  up to like 80% or something we can change that. Just let me know what percentage.

- PDF #6.
  - You have a question about the messages. At the top it says "There were validation errors. Then User Profile is invalid. Below that it says Biography cannot be blank.  Not sure what is unclear about this piece."

  - The passwords are only there if they need to be changed. I will work on hiding them to make it less confusing?

  - The photo upload should be separate from the profile page, ie., it should not do validation when you select an image. When you select an image it immediately uploads it with a progress bar.

RE: Save & Continue
  - There is nothing to continue to atm, so that is not there. I will work on making the profile more extensive.

RE: Messages
  - (No Button to send).  There is a button each profile to send. I made it so they could send right from the profile page instead of going to messages, then trying to enter the username.


Things I have on my action list:
  - Hide password boxes on profile with a "Change Password" button or link so people do not feel they need to enter their password.
  - Contact Page.
  - Expand profile page with more questions about Children, Smoking, modify like format etc.
  - Make messages more defined as to how to View. (TEST)
  - Really figure out why people with no coordinates cannot be shown.

Completed:
  - CC Exp date formatting on join page.
  - Possibly bump up the profile completion percentage for redirecting to edit profile after login?
