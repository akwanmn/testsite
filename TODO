TODO

- Birthday is pretty much mandatory, so we need to add that somehow
  so that it is there from the get go or force them to edit their profile
  before searching?



- Image on the front still looks like shit.
- CSS on dashboard when resized overlaps with footer.

- Upgrade Rails to 3.2.13

# Profile Fixes
  - Birthday - Style
  - Chosen for Timezone?
  - Password not updating?

# Dashboard
  - Title text missing above image listing?
