TODO

- Birthday is pretty much mandatory, so we need to add that somehow
  so that it is there from the get go or force them to edit their profile
  before searching?

- Image on the front still looks like shit.

# Messages
  - Skip Read At for right now. (or make read at only for the to_user, and just set it?)
  - Make communications mark as inbox, sent, archives etc.
    - Sent should be where messages.from_user = current_user
    - Archive & Trash should be the entire conversation.
    - Re: in subject?

# Profile View Page
  - Send an email from the page?

# Profile Fixes
  - Chosen for Timezone?
